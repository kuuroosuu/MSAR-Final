Program for labeling end-points

1. Install the following two toolboxes if you haven't done so yet:
	Utility Toolbox: http://mirlab.org/jang/matlab/toolbox/utility.rar
	SAP Toolbox:     http://mirlab.org/jang/matlab/toolbox/sap.rar

2. Modify the main program "goLabel.m" such that the variable "waveDir" holds the path to the wave files to be labeled.

3. Type "goLabel" under MATLAB to start labeling end-points.

4. The program will load each wave file. You can drag the red lines in the first plot to modify the end-points. (Originally the red lines coincide with the magenta and green lines, which are the end-points identified by the computer.)

5. You can hit ENTER or any key to save the file and move to the next file.

6. The end-points will be recorded in the file name. For instance, 3a.wav will be renamed as 3a_849_31226.wav if the end-points are 849 and 31226.
